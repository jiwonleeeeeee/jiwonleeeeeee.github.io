            <p> 
                My name is <em>Jiwon Lee</em>. I'm from South Korea. I've been in Canada for 5 years and came here alone. I currently live in Ottawa, and I like almost everything in this city, but I don't really like to be here in winter because I can't stand the cold. Before joining <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr>, I already have experience with web design, so it is more understandable now, and it is good to learn the parts I missed before.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have a cat. Her name is <em>Luna</em>, and she is my 2<sup>nd</sup> pet. She is losing so much hair that I can find her hair everywhere around me. I can even find her hair at my home in Korea. She is nine years old, and I've been with her for six years. I love her so much, and I hope she stays healthy and happy until she dies.
